# Python_excercise
Very first repo, for excercise

â€˜pachong' and 'pashu' is the WebCrawler for pictures and texts.

'LeetCode' is, leetcode. Still have a long long way to go

'OCW 6.00' is for the Problem Sets and tests in https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/index.htm

(remember to check 'which python', and set #!/usr/bin/env python for .py head)
